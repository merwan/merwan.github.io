I have about 10 years of professional software development experience. I develop on Linux with technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, JavaScript, etc. In the past, I spent many years developing web and Windows applications for the Microsoft .NET platform.

My goal is to design, build and ship high quality products using best practices in software development. In order to achieve this goal, I use agile practices (short iterations, user stories, TDD) and appropriate technologies.

Currently, I am working for [Teezily](https://teezily.com).
